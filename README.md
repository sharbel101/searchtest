# CapMatch

## 📘 Project Overview

**CapMatch** is an interactive matching platform designed to guide users through a form-based flow using a chatbot interface. The system will evaluate inputs through scoring and connect results to a backend for further processing. The primary interface uses `react-chatbotify` to simulate a conversational form experience.
